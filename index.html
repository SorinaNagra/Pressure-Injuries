<h3>Primary Extrinsic Factors</h3>
<p>Primary extrinsic factors: pressure, sheering force, friction, moisture, impaired mobility</p>
<div id="pressure" class="section level4">
<h4>Pressure</h4>
<p>Tissue ischemia occurs when the pressure applied to the capillary exceeds normal capillary pressure, functionally occluding the capillary</p>

<p>Occurs when the body or skeleton is moved but the skin remains fixed on the supportive surface <a href="#references">(Hannon et al., 2016)</a></p>
<p>Shearing can occur passively or upon transfer</p>
<p>Patient is sitting upright in bed, torso slides towards the foot of the bed, at the same time the skin remains fixed in place on bed linens</p>
<p>Gravity pushes down on the body as moisture and friction create resistance between patient and surface <a href="#references">(Potter et al., 2017)</a></p>

<div id="friction" class="section level4">
<h4>Friction</h4>
<p>Friction is the relative resistance cause by two surfaces sliding across each other</p>
<p>“Sheet burn” is superficial injury to tissue caused by dragging of skin across bed linings. The injured area is often red and painful <a href="#references">(Potter et al., 2017)</a></p>

<div id="moisture" class="section level4">
<h4>Moisture</h4>
<p>Persistent moisture softens skin and makes it more susceptible to damage</p>
<p>May cause irritation or changes in the skin’s protective pH <a href="#references">(Hannon et al., 2016)</a></p>
<p>Impairs the skin’s ability to resist mechanical forces (pressure/ shear)</p>

<h4>Nutrition/ Hydration Status</h4>
<p>Reduced nutritional intake results in increased risk of skin damage and diminished wound healing. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al., 2016)</a></p>
<p>Adequate protein and hydration are required to maintain a positive nitrogen balance (intake of nitrogen through protein is greater than loss), which is essential for wound healing. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al., 2016)</a></p>
<p>Negative nitrogen balance (more nitrogen excreted then consumed) is associated with illness/ injury and impedes the healing process.</p>
<p>Wound healing dependant on availability of protein, vitamins (A and C) and trace minerals (zinc and copper). <a href="#references">(Potter et al., 2017)</a></p>

<div id="circulatory-status" class="section level4">
<h4>Circulatory Status</h4>
<p>Ischemic injury is the primary mechanism for pressure ulcer development. Adequate tissue perfusion is necessary for wound healing.</p>
<p>Comorbidities such as shock or cardiovascular disease caused by diabetes cause poor circulation.</p>

<div id="other-risk-factors" class="section level3 tabset">
<h3>Other Risk Factors</h3>
<div id="infection" class="section level4">
<h4>Infection</h4>
<p>The bodies response to infection causes additional tissue destruction by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, delaying collagen synthesis and preventing epithelialization.</p>
<p>Signs of infection: erythema of surrounding tissue, pain or tenderness, edema, new areas of slough/ breakdown, undermining, and changes in odour or a change in volume/ character of wound drainage <a href="#references">(Potter et al., 2017)</a></p>
<p><br></br></p>
</div>
<div id="pain" class="section level4">
<h4>Pain</h4>
<p>Uncontrolled pain limits patient’s ability to tolerate movement. The patient’s response to pain, rapid breathing and tensing muscles, decreases tissue perfusion.</p>
<p>Pain can trigger nausea/ limit nutritional intake. <a href="#references">(Potter et al., 2017)</a></p>
<p><br></br></p>
</div>
<div id="age" class="section level4">
<h4>Age</h4>
<p>Immune impairment decreased macrophage function and delayed inflammatory response.</p>

<h2>Wound Healing</h2>
<div id="ability-to-heal" class="section level3">
<h3>Ability to Heal</h3>
<p>Existing pressure injuries can be categorized in terms of their ability to heal. Classification sets the stage of realistic treatment objectives and ensures the healthcare team, patient and family share expectations for patient outcomes and the care plan.</p>
<p>Healable wound: Adequate perfusion of tissue following risk correction allows for healing.</p>
<p>Maintenance wound: The wound has the potential to heal. Progress is stagnated by lack of resources or patient noncompliance.</p>
<p>Non-healable wounds: Wound cannot heal due to patient comorbidity, negative protein balance or in inadequate perfusion of tissue. <a href="#references">(Sibbald et al, 2012)</a></p>
</div>
<div id="healing-process" class="section level3">
<h3>Healing Process</h3>
<p>Tissue repair can occur through the replacement of cells with cells of the same type, without scarring. Alternatively, scarring occurs as connective tissue replaces lost tissue. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a></p>
<p>Wounds that do not permeate deeper layers, superficial abrasions/ partial- thickness wounds, typically heal by regeneration and do not leave a scar. (Potter et al, 2017) Epithelial tissue is composed of liable or continuously dividing cells that continuously replicate and can replace themselves. (Hannon et al, 2016) Preceding tissue repair, the inflammatory response is normally self- limited to the first 24 hours after tissue trauma. After resolution of inflammation, epithelial cells begin to regenerate. These cells proliferate at the wound edges and migrate across the wound bed. A moist wound bed promotes epithelial migration. A dry wound bed forces the cells to migrate down to a moist level before migrating across the wound bed, delaying wound healing. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>
<p>Pressure Injuries are typically classified as full- thickness wounds. These are wounds that involve the full- thickness of the skin and extend into deeper tissue such as the dermis which cannot regenerate and is replaced with scare tissue.</p>
<p>The inflammatory phase of a full-thickness wound is more profound, lasting up to 3 days. Hemostasis, the process of bleeding prevention, involves platelets aggregation and clot formation. Clotting creates a fibrin network that is later used for cellular repair. Damaged tissue and mast cells release inflammatory cytokines resulting in heat, redness and edema at the sight of injury. The inflammatory phase is beneficial, and cooling is unnecessary unless swelling occurs in a closed compartment like the neck or ankle where inflammation can cause damage. White bloods cells enter the site and remove debris, dead cells and protect against pathogens. Macrophages will release growth factors which promote fibroblast migration, which synthesize collagen (connective tissue) and form scar tissue. This stage of healing is dependant on the extent of inflammation, as profound or inadequate responses will result in delayed wound healing.</p>
<p>The proliferative phase involves angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), filling of the wound with granulation tissue and epithelialization (resurfacing by new epithelial layer). Collagen is laid down by fibroblasts to provide structural integrity. The wound will contract, shrinking the area that needs to heal. Epithelial cells migrate to the wound edges and replace the surface of the wound. Healing at this stage can be impaired by age, impaired perfusion and nutrition.</p>
<p>Remodeling/ maturation is the final healing stage where collagen scar tissue continues to gain strength over the course of years. Scar tissue tends to be less pigmented then normal skin and lacks the tensile strength of normal epithelial tissue increasing risk for subsequent pressure injury. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>

<h1>Staging</h1>
<div id="development" class="section level2">
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Pressure injured are caused by unrelieved pressure on the skin which impairs the flow of blood and lymph and leads to ischemic injury of the skin. These injuries can form on any part of the body subjected to pressure. They commonly occur over bony prominences from pressure exerted by supportive surfaces.</p>
<p>When external pressured exceed normal capillary pressure (15-32 mm Hg) capillary flow is obstructed. Following 2 hours of impaired perfusion, tissue damage occurs due to oxygen deprivation and accumulation of metabolic end products.</p>
<p>Less pressure is required to cause injury in those with impaired tissue perfusion and pressure applied to a small surface area is more damaging then pressure that is dispersed. Pressure injuries commonly occur on weight baring areas of the lower body such as the sacrum, coccygeal area, ischial tuberosity and greater trochanters.</p>
<p>When pressure is applied on the surface of the skin and to intermediate tissue against a bony prominence, the greatest pressure is at the surface of the bone. When signs of a superficial lesion are first noted, underlying tissue damage has already occurred. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a></p>

Report the stage, color, and dimensions with a sterile cotton tipped applicator. When measuring the depth, gently probe edges and observe for undermining. Don sterile gloves and clean wound with normal saline or cleaning agent to remove debris and promote wound healing.</p>
<p>Applying topical agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enzymatic debridement: thin layer over necrotic areas, thicker layers will not improve absorption. Apply non adherent gauze over the wound and tape in place</li>

<div id="nursing-interventions" class="section level1 tabset tabset-fade tabset-pills">
<h1>Nursing Interventions</h1>
<p>Wound healing exists on a continuum, weather the goal for the patient is maintenance or healing, the wound needs to be regularly reassessed and care plans need to be adjusted regularly. Your nursing judgment is valuable when determining a schedule for reassessment, as changes in the patient’s condition, application of new appliances and changes in external pressure all warrant reassessment.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<div id="assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Before the assessment a baseline needs to be established to determine the patients “normal” or typical skin condition. Pigmentation and aging may affect the manifestation of pressure injuries. A skin assessment commences on intake at HHS, according to policy, and is reassessed at least once every 24H in most cases.</p>
<p>Inspection should be focused on bony prominences, around assistive devices. Skin breakdown can occur due to orthopedic devices like casts or braces and around tubes and catheters where contact can break down the skin. For example, when patients have nasal canaliculi, check around the nostrils and behind the ears for skin breakdown. Breakdown can present as redness, blistering or breaks in the skin.</p>
<p>Hyperemia or skin redness is an early indicator of impaired tissue integrity. When hyperemia is present its important to document the location, size, color and reassess the area in an hour. If pressure is relieved after a period of ischemia, blood vessels will vasodilate resulting in transitory redness called reactive hyperemia or blanching hyperemia. Blanching is best visualised on in individual with a light skin tone as dark skin tones will not demonstrate the same change in color when pressure is applied.</p>
<p>Non-blanching erythema involves persistent skin redness that does not lighten under pressure indicates probable deep tissue damage.</p>
<p>When assessing the skin always have adequate natural or halogen light, avoid fluorescent lights. Observe for blanching of the area when pressure is removed, if patient has previously suffered a pressure injury this area of the skin may already be lighter. With deeper tissue injury or persistent inflammation, the area may appear purple- blue or violet.</p>
<p>Light palpation of the surface of the skin with fingertips to detect tenderness or induration around the lesion. In early stages of pressure ulcer development, tissue may have reduced plasticity and feel lumpy or mushy in comparison to surrounding skin. If edema is present, the skin will appear taught and shiny. Assess changes in temperature around the skin with the back of the hand, cooler skin signifies impaired perfusion of the tissue.</p>
<p>During the assessment its important to assess for risk factors such as a patient’s tolerance for pressure and their ability to meaningfully redistribute or communicate discomfort with the Braden scale. Patient preferences, such as habitual positioning may make the patient resistant to repositioning and increase the risk of skin breakdown.</p>
<p>When reporting its important to describe the patients Braden score(s), skin appearance, describe position and turning intervals, any pressure reliving devices, prevention strategies or need for additional consults. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>
<p><br></br></p>
</div>
<div id="prevention-and-intervention" class="section level2 tabset">
<h2>Prevention and Intervention</h2>
<p>Prevention of pressure related injuries involves early detection, frequent position changes to alter distribution of pressure, meticulous skin care, and management of risk factors. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a></p>
<p>Intervention measures can be guided with the use of the Braden scale used to assess risk. Changes in the patient’s condition will prompt reassessment of turning frequency and the need for pressure reducing surfaces.</p>
<p>Possible adjustments to the care plan in a patient with a mild risk or score between 15-18 should include frequent turning, maximum remobilization efforts, heel protection, implement pressure reducing supportive surfaces, managing moisture, and adjusted diet or nutrition interventions.</p>
<p>With moderate risk, scores between 13-14, in addition to mind intervention listed for moderate risk and implement 30-degree lateral position to help offload pressure with a revised turning schedule.</p>
<p>High risk, between 10-12, should include mild and moderate risk interventions with the addition of turning patients frequently with small shifts in weight.</p>
<p>At very high risk, score ≤9, implement frequent turning and reassess supportive surfaces. <a href="#references">(RNAO, 2005)</a></p>

<p>Assist with intake as necessary, assess teeth and dentures, ensure oral care, consult dietitian for nutritional evaluation as needed. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>
<p>Adequate nutrition is essential for maintain skin integrity and healing and prevention of injury. Wound healing is dependant on availability of protein, vitamins A and C and trace minerals such as zinc and copper.</p>
<p>Amino acids, Vitamin C, zinc and copper are all needed for the formation of collagen by fibroblasts. Zinc and Vitamin A also promotes epithelialization. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>
<p>Recommended intake:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calories: 35-40 Kcal/kg/day or enough to maintain positive nitrogen balance (tissue repair)</li>
<li>Protein: 1-1.5 g/kg/ day</li>
<li>Vitamin C/ Ascorbic acid: 100-1000 mg/day</li>
<li>Zinc: 30-35 mg</li>
</ul>

<div id="hydration" class="section level3">
<h3>Hydration</h3>
<p>Adequate hydration promotes skin integrity <a href="#references">(RNAO, 2005)</a></p>
<p>Recommended fluid intake consists of 30-25mL/ kg/ day of unsweetened, non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated fluid. If patient is on air-fluidized bed increase intake by 10-5 mL/ Kg.</p>
<p>Ensure adequate intake, dilute urine helps prevent skin irritation from incontinence. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>

<div id="pain-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>Staging of pressure ulcers are associated with increased pain with Stage 4 pressure ulcers being the cause of significant pain and discomfort. Pain on dressing changes caused by damage to delicate tissue can be mitigated with analgesic regimens and use of pain-relieving dressings such as those containing soft silicone. <a href="#references">(Lyder &amp; Ayello, 2008)</a></p>

<div id="patient-education" class="section level2">
<h2>Patient Education</h2>
<p>When providing patient and caregivers with information its important to address the leaning needs of the individual and be mindful of factors effecting adequate communication such as language barriers and level of education.</p>
<p>For individuals who are at risk, discharge planning should include management of risk factors to prevent injury. Patient and caregivers should understand how risk factors contribute to injury and how intervention mitigates these risks. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a> Preventative measures may include daily inspection for erythema, signs of skin injury and signs of infection in those with existing injury. Other preventive measures may include turning every 2 hours or repositioning in seat every 15 minutes, proper topical skin care and adequate diet and hydration should be ensured. <a href="#references">(RNAO, 2005)</a></p>
<p>The Family should be provided with access to resources and equipment for appropriate management. Intervention such as pressure relieving maneuvers should be individualised for the patient in their home environment.</p>
<p>Define the objective and explain the purpose and proper body mechanics pertaining to mobility aid, pressure- redistribution surface or maneuver and assess the patient of families understanding.</p>
<p>An effective evaluation measure is the teach-back method where the patient and family will state the purpose and describe function and proper use of the intervention they will be implementing in the community. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>

<h1>Summary of Guidelines</h1>
<p>Pressure ulcers are painful and preventable damage caused by external pressure, typically over a bony prominence, causing inadequate perfusion of the tissue. <a href="#references">(Potter et al, 2017)</a></p>
<p>Healthy individuals can unconsciously redistribute weight and pressure on the skin, only becoming aware of discomfort when movement is restricted. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a></p>
<p>Carful observation and management of risk factors aimed at prevention of pressure injury development in those identified to be at risk with use of validated assessment tool (Braden scale) on intake. <a href="#references">(RNAO, 2005)</a></p>
<p>After damage has occurred, prevention measures protect against further ischemic damage. There in an increased risk of infection and wound healing measures are implemented. <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a></p>
<p>Managing risk:</p>
<p>reposition every 2 hours to allow ischemic areas to recover <a href="#references">(Hannon et al, 2016)</a> Patient should remain at a 30-degree lateral position offsets pressure on the trochanter (RNAO, 2005)</p>
<p>Other prevention measures include topical skin care to control moisture especially in incontinent patients, adequate nutrition and hydration to promote wound healing, and provision of pressure leaving surfaces. <a href="#references">(Abound &amp; Manna, 2019)</a></p>
